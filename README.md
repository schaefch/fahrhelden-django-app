# Fahrhelden Django App

## About
This is the django backend app for *Fahrhelden*. In German, Fahrhelden means something like "heroes of driving".

## Idea
Fahrhelden is a covid-born app for the coordination of helping each other within a neighborhood.
The idea is that so called bringers can do jobs for older people that previously called a hotline.
This hotline then accepts jobs, such as buying food from the local market, and inserts this into the database.

## Details
The app relies on the django rest framework and djoser, building the base for a frontend app.
